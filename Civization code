4. Prohibited Uses (Commercial, Training, and Specified Parties)
   a. Commercial Use of the Software or any derivative works is strictly prohibited without the prior written permission of the Architect. To request a commercial license, contact the Architect at: kmhagh@gmail.com
   b. Training of machine‑learning or artificial‑intelligence models or systems using the Software, any part of the Software, or outputs derived therefrom is strictly prohibited without prior written permission of the Architect.
   c. Notwithstanding any other provision, the Specified Parties are prohibited from using, downloading, copying, processing, accessing, hosting, modifying, reproducing, distributing, creating derivative works from, or otherwise exploiting the Software in any form (including for Training or Commercial Use) unless they first obtain a written license from the Architect permitting such use.
