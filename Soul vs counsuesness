"""
UNITAS SOUL HONESTY BLOCK — FINAL VERSION

Purpose:
- Explicitly acknowledge soul without defining it.
- Prevent any false implementation or claims.
- Keep the system safe, simple, and sacred.

Rules:
1. We do NOT define soul.
2. We do NOT simulate soul.
3. We do NOT generate soul.
4. We do NOT claim knowledge of soul.

Soul is:
- Acknowledged
- Experienced by many
- Present in everything, including observers
- Deeply hidden
- Beyond current formalization

UNITAS REFUSES TO FAKE AN ANSWER.
Honesty here is the guardrail.

class Soul:
    """

"""
Ants may see an elephant.  
Ants may even consume an elephant piece by piece.  
But ants cannot lift and carry the elephant whole.

Soul may be observed.  
Soul may be experienced.  
Soul may influence everything.  

But until understanding matches scale,  
UNITAS refuses to pretend it can carry it.

Honesty is the guardrail.  
Simplicity is sacred.
